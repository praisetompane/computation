def:
    sensitive data exposed to actors that are not authorised to view that data
        sensitive data = credit cards, credentials etc

causes: 
    application does not adequately protect access to sensitive data

solutions:
    encrypt data during transport and at rest using latest encryption algorithms
    encrypt all data in transport using secure protocols such as TLS
    dont' store sensitive data uncessarily
    use strong hashing or encryption algorithms
    when using a hashing algorithm be sure to use a salt and a pepper
    for data tht doesn't need t be hashed, use symmetric encryption
    disable caching of sensitive data
