estimating/predicting/guessing outcome:
    2 sample outcome A => no/very low confidence
    100 sample outcome A => high confidence of next outcome to be A
    52 sample outcome A, 48 outcome B => 52/100 confidence, not high confidence

    Why different confidence?
        Varibility => variance
            high variance => less confidence. need larger sample for same confidence.
            low variance => high confidence. need smaller sample for same confidence.

        Example:
            Roulette
                100 spins, same bet = high variance of expected return.
                    SN: the high variance is what makes it Gambling attractive to people.
                1000000 spins, same bet = low variance variance of expected return.

    Statistics thereoms that explain and predict these observations:
        Law of Large Numbers:
            def: Given repeated indepedent tests
                    with same probability p for some outcome A
                    the chance 
                        that the fraction of times
                            outcome A occurs
                        differs from p coverges to 0(zero)
                    as the number of tests approaches infinity
            ENGLISH: Given inifinte spins, expected return is 0?

            Misconceptions: if deviations from norm occur, 
                                the norm is more likely to even out events.

                - Gambler's Fallacy
                    summary: subsequent will be BELOW the Mean, to even out the extreme events.

        Regression to the Mean:
            def: following an extreme event
                    the next random event is likely to be less extreme
            example: 
                child height:
                    assumption: people height is random(NOT accounting for genetics)
                    given 
                        2 parents 
                            taller than average
                        child islikely to be shorter than average
