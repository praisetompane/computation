# 7_artitificial_intelligence

the science of giving computers the ability to act intelligently.¹

## subsets²

* Narrow AI: Theory and develpment of computing sytems that perform tasks that augment for human intelligence such perception, classification, reasoning, learning, abstracting and/or acting etc
* General AI: Theory and develpment of fully autonous computing sytems


## constraint:
* compute
* data
* generalisable knowledge and ability to encode it into algorithm

## four waves of AI³
  - Reasoning
  - Learning
  - Context
  - Abstraction

  Dimensions:
    - §g
    - Learning
    - Abstracting
    - Reasoning
  
  Contraints:
    Compute power
    Data(Size and Quality)
    Ability to encode knowledge into algorithm

  - Reasoning: Explicity define what the rules of a domain are.
    - Perceiving: Low
    - Learning: None
    - Abstracting: None
    - Reasoning: High
  - Learning: Learn what the rules of a domain could be from data.
    domain = {language processing, investor transacting, ... }
    - Perceiving: High
    - Learning: High
    - Abstracting: Low
    - Reasoning: Low
  - Context: System can add context into what it is doing.
    - Perceiving: High
    - Learning: Mid
    - Abstracting: High
    - Reasoning: High
  - Abstraction: Abstract and transfer knowledge from one domain to and apply in another.
    - Perceiving: High
    - Learning: High
    - Abstracting: High
    - Reasoning: High
