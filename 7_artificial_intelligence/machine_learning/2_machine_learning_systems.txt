Main Regions and Notable landmarks of the Continent of Machine Learning¹:

    Are they trained with/without human supervision and what type of supervision?
        S1: Supervised Learning
        S2: Unsupervised Learning
        S3: Semi-Supervised Learning
        S4: Reinforcement Learning

    Can they learn incrementally on the fly(i.e. real time)?
        I1: Batch Learning
        I2: Online Learning 

    Do they wpok by just matching new points to known points or identify patterns in training data to build a predicitive model(like scientists)?
        P1: Instance Based Learning
        P2:  Model Based Learning 


    S1:
        def: algorithm is given training data 
            with labelled instances
                (i.e. labels say what the instance is)
                Example: Spam or Ham email, Cat or Dog, Number or Letter, etc
        
        def instance: a manifestation of class of object

        def class: a category
            Example: Cat
        
        Typical use cases:
            classification:
                training data instances are labelled with a "class"

            regression: 
                using a set of features(predictors) to predict a TARGET NUMERIC value.
                can also be used for classification(e.g. logistic regression)

        def attribute: a property/datatype of an object
            height (for a person)
            cylinders (for an engine)

        def feature(common): an attribute and its value
            height = 180cm
            cylinders = 6


        Important Algorithms:
            - K-Nearest neighbour
            - Linear Regression
            - Logistic Regression
            - Support Vector Machines
            - Decision Trees and Random Forests
            - Neural Networks(can also be unsupervised)
