WHY?: When you need a METHOD that returns ONE of SEVERAL classes with a COMMON SUPERCLASS
      ->   Ability to CHOOSE classes at runtime
WHEN:
  1. Don't know ahead of time the type of class object you need (as long as those classes
  share a common supertype)
  2. Need to encapsulate object creation
  3. Centralise class selection code
  4. Don't want the use to know every subclass
