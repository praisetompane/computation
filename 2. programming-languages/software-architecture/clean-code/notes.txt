Chap 3

Functions
  SHOULD DO ONE THING ONLY
  One level of abstraction per function
  Should not be able extract another function without just restating the name of the current
  Read code from top to bottom
    nesting levels of abstract as separate function calls

Switch statements
  Rule of thumb
    bury switch statements in an low-level Abstract Factory (refer to Gang Of Four)
      must be used to instantiate objects of the types it's checking
    NEVER REPEAT!
    dispatch the different functions polymorphically through an Interface

Error handling
  Do NOT return error codes
  try{}catch{} behaviour deserves it's own function (otherwise you're doing MORE THAN 1 THING)
