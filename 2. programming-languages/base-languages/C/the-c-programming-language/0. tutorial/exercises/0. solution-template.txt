    Objective:
        Print histogram
            of word lengths 
                from input

    Assumptions:
        Legth on y x-axis in picture
        
    Constraints:
        White characaters are not included in legth(tab, space, newline etc)
        Maximum 50 characaters considered for histogram

    Algorithm flow:
        wordLengthCount: Array[50] -- can be later a CLI input
        currentWordChaacterCount = 0
        initilaise wordLengthCount to 0 for all elements
        read character
            if non white character
                ++currentWordChaacterCount
            else
                increment wordLengthCount for this length of word
                ++wordLengthCount[currentWordChaacterCount]
                currentWordChaacterCount = 0 

    Example(s):
        aba  pr i 
        [1,1,1,1 ...]

        currentWordChaacterCount = 0
