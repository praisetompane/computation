Computer Science
  How represent knowledge 
    The brain is nothing more than a computational object?

    Our noses, eyes, tongues (i.e. sense are simply data highway peripherals (they can only carry so much data)??
    Can we not increase the width of these buses?
  
  HUMANITIES GREATEST LIMITATION
  Data (Peripheral) —————————-> Brain (Process to Information) -> Refine to Knowledge -> Experience

Information Systems

  How do we actually align the business strategy and the information technology business's strategy (i.e.
    The IT Department) to achieve the following:

    Ensure I.T becomes a strategic enabler and partner for the business
    Ensure business value generated by IT far exceeds the IT spend

    Can this be achieve?
      If yes, how would a traditional enterprise achieve this?
        What tools and frameworks can we employ?

        -> Do we use Governance frameworks such as COBIT and KING 3?

      If no, why can this not be achieved?
            Why can the traditional enterprise not achieve this?
            Are modern tech startups the only types of businesses that will reap the enablement
            of technology because at their hear they are technology companies?


  How to build actual enterprise software applications. -> Scalability, Security, Robustness 
  How long until we have to rewrite code bases that get un maintainable. 
    Write single purpose applications, ADD NOTHING MORE. Each category of features are encapsulated into an application.
