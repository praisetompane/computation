Session 1:
  Intuition about Process(How to knowledge)
  Procedure: Pattern of rules that direct the Process

  Techniques for controlling complexity
    1.1. Black box abstraction (Building and composing boxes of functionality(i.e boxes that know how to do something))

      - Primitive Objects
        Primitive procedures
        Primitive data

      - Means of Combination
        Procedure composition
        Construction of compound data

      - Means of Abstraction
        Procedure definition
        Simple data abstraction

      - Capturing Common Patterns
        High-order procedures
        Data as procedures

    1.2. Conventional Interfaces(Agreed upon ways of connecting things together)
      (* x (a + b)): How can we build in a way that a and b can be anything?

        - Generics operations
        - Large scale structure and modularity
        - Object Orientated Programming
        - Operations on aggregates


    1.3. Metalinguistic abstraction


Session 2:
  Questions at the beginning of assessing a language

    Primitive elements
    Means of combination
    Means of abstractions

    LISP
      Primitive elements = 1, 3 etc
      
      Means of combination = ()
      (* 37.5 5) -> combination (LISP's means of combinations)
        : Apply an operator to operands

     Means of abstractions
        (define A (* 5 4))
        (* A A)
