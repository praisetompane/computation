Object layer that models the business area you're working in

    Objects that mimic data
    Objects that capture the business rules (processes?)

    Types:
        1. Simple domain model
        2. Rich model model

        1. Maps very closely if not completely to the database
           Well suited for Active Record (160) for mapping top the database

        2. For more complex problems
           Use a variety of interconnected objects (Strategies etc)
           We'll often use a a Data Mapper(165) for mapping top the database
