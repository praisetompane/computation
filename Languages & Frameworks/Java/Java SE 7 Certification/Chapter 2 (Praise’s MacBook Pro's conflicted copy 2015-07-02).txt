
Data Types and Variables

	Variable Types
		Instance
		Static
		Local
Eight Java Primitive Types

	Size In Bytes	Range
boolean 	—	true/false
byte		1	8 bytes
char		2
short		2
int		4
long		8
float		4	
double		8

Money Representation

	BigDecimal class is the recommended datatype to store money
		
		Key notes:
			-Use string as parameter to constructor
			-It is immutable
			-ROUND_HALF_EVEN provides less bias

	Currency class is used to control the formatting of the figures

	Common other representation conventions

		Less than 10 digits : int or BigDecimal
		Less than 19 digits: long or BigDecimal
		Greater than 19 digits: BigDecimal

String class

Wrapper Classes and Autoboxing

	Purpose: wrap primitive types to use them as objects.

	Necessary when adding primitive type to collections (ArrayList etc)

	Collections deal with items as objects

	Wrapper class type

-Boolean
-Byte
-Character
-Short
-Integer
-Float (used for Double as well)

Note: wrapper class objects are immutable(values cannot change)

Auto boxing: Automatic conversion of primitives to wrapper classes

Unboxing: conversion of wrapper objects to corresponding primitive

Key Notes
	Primitives cannot be null

	Objects can be null


Variable Initialisation

	Default initial values
	Instance variable initialisers
	Instance variable
	Constructors


	Default initial values

		bool: false
		byte: 0
		char: ‘\u0000’
		short: 0
		int: 0
		long: 0L
		float: 0.0F
		double: 0.0d
		String: null [all objects are null]

Java constants, literals, and enumerations

constants and literals cannot be changed

	final String name = “Praise”;//constant variable, value cannot change

	’35’ or ‘C’ represent a specific value. It cannot be changed, obviously!
	


	Note: There is some material missing above the below concept

The Final keyword

	Used to declare constants.
	Uses list:

		primitive type: variable is constant, value cannot change

		reference variables: the reference variable cannot be changed to reference another object/variable. The object/variable referenced can be changed.

		method: The method cannot be overridden

	class: the class cannot be extended

Enumerations

	subclasses if java.lang.Enums

	Same as C/C++ enums

Immutable objects

	object’s whose field values cannot be changed

Instance vs Static

	Each object get its own Instance variables
		Instance variables are for the lifetime of the OBJECT

	Static variables are created once and shared across the objects of a class
		Static variables are for the lifetime of the CLASS

		e.g. A universal discount applied to all customers
			
   			private static float discountPercentage;

Access Modifiers

	public: visible to everyone in the system
	protected: visible to a parent class and its subclasses.
		   Visible to classes int the same package?
	private: visible only to the class that declared it
	package: visible at a package level. Any class in the same package can access it.
		Default java access modifier applied
