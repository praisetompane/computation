# Language

## Objectives
- An in-depth study of:
    - Language's Compiler/Intepreter.
    - This focuses on:
        - []()
    - Language's language design, implementation and ecosystem.
## Language Details
  - [language specification]()
    - the syntax and semantics description
    - key topics:
      - implementations
      - lexical analysis
      - data model
        - standard type hierarchy
      - execution model
  - [language reference]()
  - [base modules index]()
  - [standard library reference]()
  	- commonly used and required features of a language
		e.g. collections
  - package management:
    - [packaging]()
    - tools:
    - structuring projects:
  - [package index]()
  - [extending and embedding]()
  - [developer contribution guide]()
  - [compiler/interpreter]()
  - memory model:
    - [computational complexity cost model]()
  - history:
  - usage:
    - the style of effective programs, with emphasis on idioms
    - fundamentals
      - value declaration
      - decision structures
      - iteration structures
    - algorithms and data structure implementations

## Testing
