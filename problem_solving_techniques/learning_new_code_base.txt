1. Learn the programming language
    1.1. The entire Standard Tutorial
    1.2. The implementation and usage of standard Algorithms and Data Structure(stacks, queues, etc) in that language
    1.3. The entire Standard Library:
        - Browse Standard Library, just the headings to learn what's in it.
        - Browse Glossary, just the headings to learn what's in it.
        - Read the Standard Library
        - Read the Glossary
    1.4. Learn How The Language works:
        - Compiler/Interpreter
        - ...
    - ...
2. Learn all external libraries and frameworks independent of the current code base.
    This makes it easier to understand their specific usage in the code base.
3. Learn the Core Abstractions(The Domain) of the code base.
4. Learn the build and deployment tool chain.
5. Learn the underlying program design principles, why they were chosen and their goals.
6. put it all together.
