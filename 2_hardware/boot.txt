how do we start a computer from nothing?
    1. preset the IAR to be a specific value when the computer power is turned on.
        e.g. 11111110
             âˆ´ the next instruction to be executed will be at address 11111110.

        see: 4_computation/2_hardware/a_simple_computer_implementation/12_instructions.txt

    2. use first ~32 bytes of RAM as ROM(Read Only Memory) starting at address preloaded into IAR.
       preload the ~32 bytes with a program that:
            - reads head 0, track 0 sector 0 of hard drive/storage medium.
            - write the sector into RAM.
            - jump to first byte of RAM to which the sector was written.
        
    3. execute the bytes written by step 2.
        NB: we expect the sector 0 to contain a program to run the computer(i.e. Q: the OS or kernel?).
            this sector is named the 'boot record'

def bootstrap loader: TBD
