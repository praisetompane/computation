1. We can use a bit to 'represent' something else in our lives

2. A code: something that tells you what something else means

e.g When the bit is on turn the light red, which means stop
    When the bit is off turn the light red, which means go

    When the bit is on I need the order with fries
    When the bit is off I need the order without fries 
    
Limitation, we can only represent yes or no matters right now
