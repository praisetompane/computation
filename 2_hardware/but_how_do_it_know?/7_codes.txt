def computer codes (Not programming language code):
    a mapping that 
        associates the 256 states a byte can be in
        with something else (Scott, 2009:22).

        example: 
            ASCII for associating the byte states with letters of the English alphabet:

                Character   Binary(Byte State)    
                    A           01000001                   
                    a           01100001                
                    .           .                       
                    .           .                       
                    .           .                       

    the byte states mean nothing to a computer,
        we assign meaning/semantics using these codes (Scott, 2009:22).
            - the meaning is based on context:
            
                Binary(Byte State)      Context             Meaning
                    01000001            Written Language    'A'
                    01000001            Arithmetic          65
