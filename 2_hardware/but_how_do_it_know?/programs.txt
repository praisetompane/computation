        - operating system
            program used:

                - assist the application programs.

    based on the size, programs tend to be given different names(Scott, 2009:71):
        system: collection of programs solving a problem.
        program: a single sequence of instructions solving a problem.
        routine: a sequence of instructions solving a subset of problem.
        subroutine: a sequence of instructions solving a subset of a routine.

        NB: These are not precise definitions.
            The general name for all these is Program.
