def register (Scott, 2009:24):
    formal:

    plain english: 
        memory byte connected to an enabler.
        it stores/records (i.e. "registers") the state of the byte
            for use by other things/processes.

        NB: It can only store one state of the byte at a time.
            If a new byte state is set (i.e. "enabled")
                the previous state is overridden.
