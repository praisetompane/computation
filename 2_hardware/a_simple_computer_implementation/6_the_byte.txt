Chapter: Eight is enough (Scott, 2009:21).

def Byte: a thing that has 8 separate LOCATIONS in SPACE
          each of which can be either on or off, that are kept in same order (Scott, 2009:21).

          The byte as a whole is a thing that has a LOCATION in SPACE
          has the quality that any given time it is in ONE of 256 possible states
          It can be changed back and forth between these states

We now have a tool that can help us overcome the limitation of a single bit (Scott, 2009:21).
    We can begin to represent matters more complex than yes/no (Scott, 2009:21).
