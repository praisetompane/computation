What is in a Computer? (Scott, 2009:8)
    BIT
        bit : a lot of bits (Just a little bit)
        def bit: some kind of physical object that has a SIZE and LOCATION in SPACE.
                has the quality that any given time it is in ONE of ONLY TWO possible states.
                It can be changed back and forth between those states.

                In a Computer, they either HAVE ELECTRICITY or DO NOT HAVE ELECTRICITY

                Computer bit: just a place that either HAS ELECTRICITY or DOES NOT HAVE ELECTRICITY
    
    The bit includes the wire
