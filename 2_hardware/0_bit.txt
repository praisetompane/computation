def bit (Scott, 2009:8): some kind of physical object that has a SIZE and LOCATION in SPACE.
                            has the quality that any given time it is in ONE of ONLY TWO possible states.
                            It can be changed back and forth between those states.

                            In a Computer, they either HAVE ELECTRICITY or DO NOT HAVE ELECTRICITY

                            Computer bit: just a place that either HAS ELECTRICITY or DOES NOT HAVE ELECTRICITY
    
    NB: The bit includes the wire


def memory bit (Scott, 2009:16):
    formal:

    plain english: 
        four NAND gates
            with special wiring to "remember"
                the value of the input wire.
