def byte: 
    formal:

    plain english: a thing that has 8 separate LOCATIONS in SPACE
                        each location can be either on or off
                        and are kept in same order (Scott, 2009:21).
    
                    i.e. 8 bits.

    properties:
        - is always in one of 256 possible states
            possible states = 2⁸
                8 bits each of which has 2 possible states
        - can be changed arbitrarily between states

def memory byte (Scott, 2009:21):
    formal:

    plain english: 
        byte made from 
            eight memory bits
            
Q: Are there any usages of bytes NOT made from memory bits?

def enabler (enable byte) (Scott, 2009:24):
    formal:

    plain english: 
        eight AND gates
            with second input of each gate
            all connected into one input 'e'(enable)

        NB: used almost every time we want to remember the state of a byte. 
    
    flow:
        e is 'off/0':
            inputs into enabler do reach output 'o'
        e is 'on/1':
            inputs into enabler reach output 'o' unchanged


def register (Scott, 2009:24):
    formal:

    plain english: 
        memory byte connected to an enabler.
        it stores/records (i.e. "registers") the state of the byte
            for use by other things/processes.

        NB: It can only store one state of the byte at a time.
            If a new byte state is set (i.e. "enabled")
                the previous state is overridden.
