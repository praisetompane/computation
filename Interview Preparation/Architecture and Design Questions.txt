Tell me a recent technical challenge you were faced with and how did you deal with it?
    Migration of a tranasction from a large monolith violating many principles such as Single Responsibility and coding to interfaces.
    The challenge here was that we had classes instantiating classes that further instantiated classes(This was a few levels deep)

    Approach:
        1. Migrate the transaction as is, getting it compiling
        2. Migrate tests
        3. Refactor implementation to code to contracts at the main ochestration class definition
            Inject all its dependecies
