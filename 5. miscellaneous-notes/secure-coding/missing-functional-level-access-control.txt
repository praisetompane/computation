def:
    users can perform actions they are not authorisef for
    resources can be accessed by unauthorised users

causes: 
    access checks not implemented
    misconfigured access check mechanism/protection mechanism

    examples:
        forced browsing URLs:
            authenticated user of a site guesses/brute forces URLs to find unprotected administrative page

        access unauthorised functions:
            authenticated user
                knows framework => crafts URL(to an endpoint) to create a user with elevated priviledges
                    - happens if the endpoint is protected by access control checks

solutions:
    protect all business functions using a server side role based access authorization mechanism
    authorization should be applied using centralised routines provided by the framework or easy to use external modules
    always deny access by default(least access principle)
    implement functional access control on the server and NEVER the client
