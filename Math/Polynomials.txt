Polynomial Def: the sum of a FINITE number of terms
                    where each term has 
                        - a coefficient 
                        - being multiplied by a variable raised to non-negative integer power (the power needs to be a literal integer)

                        Ax2 + By4 + 9
                            A -> coefficient
                            x -> variable
                            2 -> integer power


                            B -> coefficient
                            y -> variable
                            4 -> integer power     

                            9 can be rewritten as:
                            9z0 => 9 * 1 = 9 (simplication)
                                9 -> coefficient
                                z -> variable
                                0 -> integer power 

Concepts
    monomial:  1 term
    binomial:  2 terms
    trinomial: 3 terms    
    degree of a polynomial : highest exponent of all the terms
    degree of a given term of a polynomial: exponent of a term
    leading
        leading term
        leading coefficient
        -> This has to do with writing polynomials in Standard Form
        Standard Form -> writing terms of a polynomial in decreasing degree order (i.e. highest order first)
