implementation of operations (Scott, 2009:91):
    subtraction:
        components:
                - Adder.
                - NOT gates.
        given:
            registers:
                - R0
                - R1
        objective: 
            subtract R1 from R0
            i.e. R0 - R1
        then:
            NOT R1 into R1
            Add 1 to R1
            Add R0 to R1


        Q:  Why does applying NOT and ADD result in subtraction? 
            Why do you have to add 1 after applying NOT? 
            Why do you ignore the carry bit?
    
    multiplication:
        given:
            registers:
                - R0
                - R1
            then:
                multiply every bit
                    of the one factor
                    with every bit of the other factor.
                rules for the bit multiplication:
                    1 × 1 = 1
                    0 × 1 = 0
                    1 × 1 = 0
                    0 × 0 = 0
        NB: This is an O(N²) operations
        Q: Verify this.
