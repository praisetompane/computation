def byte: 
    formal:

    plain english: a thing that has 8 separate LOCATIONS in SPACE
                        each location can be either on or off
                        and are kept in same order (Scott, 2009:21).
    
                    i.e. 8 bits.

    properties:
        - is always in one of 256 possible states
            possible states = 2⁸
                8 bits each of which has 2 possible states
        - can be changed arbitrarily between states
