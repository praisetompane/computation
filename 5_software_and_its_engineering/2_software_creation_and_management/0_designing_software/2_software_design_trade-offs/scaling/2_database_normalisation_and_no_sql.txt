context: joins across database tables get slow as the system grows larger. 
            You want to avoid them
    growth function:
        O(S1 * S2 * S3 ...*Sₙ)
        O(Table1 * Table2 * Table3 ...Tableₙ)

solutions:
    - denormalization
    - NoSQL

def: denormalization: store redundant data in database to speed up reads

    practical example:
        store related data, but distinct data on one table
        instead of separate ones linked by keys
        
        given, tables: 
            project:
                project_id PK
                name
                due_date
                ...
            task:
                task_id PK
                project_id FK
                name
                due_date
                description
                assignee
                ...
        can be:
            project_task
                project_task_id
                project_name
                task_name
                due_date
                description
                assignee
