def api-first design:
    - formal: ???

        - in words: a product implementation philosophy, characterized by API as first-class citizens and key abstractions for modelling
                        the product. 

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - standardized, consistent and reusable APIs: 
            https://swagger.io/resources/articles/difference-between-api-documentation-specification/
        - benefits:
            - development teams can work in parallel:
                - API first allows teams to design contract which other teams can build against.
                - for testing, teams can stub responses and dependencies.
            - reduce the cost of product development:
                - APIs can be reused in various applications.
            - increases the speed to market:
                - APIs can be reused without starting over per product.
                - API building can be automated by starting with API Definition files which can be used code generators.
                    - tools:
                        - https://swagger.io/api-hub/
                - Allows adding new technologies without re-architecture
            - ensures a good developer experience
            - reduces risk of failure 

        - execution plan:
            - brainstorm: figure out which services should be exposed as APIs
            - define API stakeholders
            - design API contract: API standards = {naming, versioning, URLs, response codes}
            - design API style guide
            - implement API governance:
                - https://swagger.io/solutions/governance-and-standardization/
            - automate processes:
                - style validation
                - make APIs self service
                - api mocking and versioning
                - interactive documentation or sandboxes to allow experimentation
            - track and manage your API portfolio
            - create API portal
