def: splitting a dataset across multiple locations
        and knowing where(location) each portion is stored.

types:
    - horizontal??
    - vertical
    - key-based(hash-based)
    - directory-based

    - vertical:
        partitioning by feature
        limitation: each feature(vertical slice) can get large
                        thus would need to partition that.
                            possibly with a different partition method => more complexity
        pratical example:
            given:
                social network:
                    friends
                    messages
                    profile
            partition accross:
                database server 1: friends
                database server 2: messages
                database server 3: profiles
    
    - key-based(hash-based):
        use some part of the data to partition by.

        pratical simple example:
            allocate N servers
            use mod(key, n) to allocate data with identifier = key to server n
                limitation := fixed number of servers
                                adding additional servers requires, reallocation(EXPENSIVE OPERATION).

    - directory-based:
        maintain look up table of where data is located.
        allows for easy additinal servers
        limitation: 
            directory is a single point of failure
            performance impact from frequent access of directory
