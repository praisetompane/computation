    - Vertical
        increase the resources of a specific node.
        easier, but limited as you can only add a finite amount of resources to a single node.

        pratical example:
            increase the machine resources the system runs on.
                machine resources = {CPU, memory, storage, network interface,...}
                
        l   imited as there is a finite amount of additional machine resources you can add.

    - Horizontal
        increaet the number of nodes.

        pratical example:
            increase the instances of the system running in parallel
                all using the same data source
