context: joins across database tables get slow as the system grows larger. 
            You want to avoid them
    growth function:
        O(S1 * S2 * S3 ...*Sₙ)
        O(Table1 * Table2 * Table3 ...Tableₙ)

solutions:
    - denormalisation
    - NoSQL

def: denormalisation: store redundant data in database to speed up reads

    pratical example:
        store related data, but distinct data on one table
        instead of separate ones linked by keys
        
        given, tables: 
            project:
                projectId PK
                name
                duedate
                ...
            task:
                taskId PK
                projectId FK
                name
                duedate
                description
                assignee
                ...
        can be:
            project_task
                projectTaskId
                projectname
                taskname
                taskduedate
                description
                assignee
