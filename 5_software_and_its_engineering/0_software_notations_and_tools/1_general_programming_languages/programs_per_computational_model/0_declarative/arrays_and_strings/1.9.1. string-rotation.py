Context:
    Given:
        method isSubstring
            checks if one word is a substring of another

Definitions:
    rotation = letters moved n places left/right
        split string into two parts
            x,y
            rotated  string = yx
            original string = xy
        --------------------------------------
            s1 = abcd
            s2 = cdab

            s1
                x = ab
                y = cd
                yx = cdab = s2

    is not:
        shuffling letters into arbitary positions

Objective:
    Given two strings
        s1 and s2

    Write Algorithm to check
        if s2 is a
            rotation
                of s1

Assumptions:
    s1 and s2 are same length
Constraints:
    Only 1 call to isSubstring

Algorithm flow:
    Using definition of rotation
        yxyx contains xy
        cdabcd contains abcd

    Flow:
        s2contact = concat s2 and s2
        check if s1 isSubstring of s2contact
