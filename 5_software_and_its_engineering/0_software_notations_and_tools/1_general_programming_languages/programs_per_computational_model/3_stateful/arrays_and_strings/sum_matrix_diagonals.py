#
# Complete the 'diagonal_difference' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
# The function accepts 2D_INTEGER_ARRAY arr as parameter.

"""
Context:
    Given:
        sqaure matrix
            i.e. width = lenght (e.g. 3 * 3)
Objective:
    calculate the absolute difference
        between sum of its diagonals

Assmptions:
    matrix is never empty

Constraints:
    -100 <= arr[i][j] <= 100

Example:
    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    9 8 9

    left_diagonal  = 1 + 5 + 9 = 15
    right_diagonal = 3 + 5 + 9 = 17
    absolute_difference = |17 - 15| = 2

Flow:
    left_diagonal = arr[0][0] + arr[1][1] + arr[2][2]
    right_diagonal = arr[2][0] + arr[1][2] + arr[0][2]
    absolute_difference = |left_diagonal - right_diagonal|
    return absolute_difference

Performance:
    O(L). L is the dimension(either width or length of) of the matrix
