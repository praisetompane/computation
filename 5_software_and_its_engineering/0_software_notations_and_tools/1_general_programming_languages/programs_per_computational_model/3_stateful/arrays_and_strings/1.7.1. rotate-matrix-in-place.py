"""
Context:
    Given Image
        Represented by N*N matrix
        Each pixel = 4bytes

Definitions:
    Rotate by 90 degrees?
        = (x,y) => (y, -x)

Objective:
    Function to rotate the image 90 degrees

Assumptions:
    Rotation is clockwise

Constraints:

Algorithm flow:
    Clockwise Rotation => (x,y) => (y, -x)

    create swapped hash table

    for each point (row,col) in grid
        if not in swapped
            new_cartesian_point = apply Clockwise Rotation above
            matrix_point = apply  Map to Matrix
            swap values at (row, col) with values matrix point
            add (row, col) and matrix point to swapped

Possible Solutions

Example(s):
    N = 4
    New Image:
        XXX
        XXX
        XXX
    Swapped = (0,0)
              (O,1)
              (1,0)
              (0,2)
              (2,0)
              (1,1)
              (1,2)
              (2,1)
              (2,2)
    Current Image:
        ABC  (0,0)(0,1)(0,2)
        EFG  (1,0)(1,1)(1,2)
        IJK  (2,0)(2,1)(2,2)

    Result:

        AEI
        BFJ
        CGK
