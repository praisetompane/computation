"""
Given:
    array of integers
Objective:
    return a frequency array of the elements
        count the number of times a value appears in the array
    NB: Aways return a 100 value frequency array
Assumptions:

Example:
    arr = [1, 1, 3, 2, 1]
    values range = [0 ... 3]

Flow
    frequencies = [0] * values range
    for n in arr:
        frequencies[n] += 1
    from the start of the array(i.e. index 0)
        append each index(i.e. the number) to sorted array
            as many times as stiputed by its frequncy

# => result will be a sorted array
Constraints:
    100 <= n <= 10^6 : size of the array
    0 <= arr[i] < 100 range of values
Performance
        𝑂(𝑁): we visit each array element
        O(100): initialise frequncy table of size 100
        O(N + 100) = 𝑂(𝑁) : drop constants
