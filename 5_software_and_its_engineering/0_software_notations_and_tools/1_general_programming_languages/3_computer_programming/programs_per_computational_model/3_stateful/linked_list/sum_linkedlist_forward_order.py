"""
Context:
    Given two numbers represented as a
        each represented as a (singly)linkedlist

Objective:
    Write function that:
        adds the two numbers
        returns sum as linkedlist

Defintions:

Constraints:

Assumptions:
    base 10 number system
Example:

    input = (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5)
    output = (9 -> 1 -> 2)

Options:
    1: Use doubly linked list
        keep pointer to head and tail
        for forward addition
            start from the tail.
        I CHOOSE THIS ONE, as per the book progression I do not know Stacks yet! :)
    2. Use stacks
        convert the linked list into stacks
            - Can be:
                - a node based stack
                - a list based stack
            7   5
            1   9
            6   2
                removing the head and add it to stack
                the last value(i.e. ones places will be the first values we process(i.e.))
            Each place value addition result is added to a stack
                We'll start at the ones,
                therefore the highest place value(i.e. will be the last inserted, thus the first removed when
                converting the result to integer)
        result stack
            9
            1
            2
            which is equal to 912
