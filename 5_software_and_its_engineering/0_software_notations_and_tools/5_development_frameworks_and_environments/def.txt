def framework: a structure to build software on/in 
                often the structure is for a specific type of task(i.e. software/application)
                    frameworks =    {  web application framework,
                                        mobile application framework,
                                        desktop application framework,
                                        game framework,
                                        ...,
                                        taskâ‚™ application framework
                                    }
                        
                often the structure provides base functionality required
                    for the specific type of task (Code Academy, 2021).
                    e.g.    web application frameworks provides HTTP server
