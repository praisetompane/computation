Context:
    String compression
        using counts
            of repeated characters
Definitions:

Objective:

Assumptions:
    Only lower and upper case letters present

Constraints:

Inputs:
    string value

Algorithm flow:
    Compress the string
    if string empty: return empty
    if length of compressed string >= original string
        return original string
    else
        return compressed string

Example(s):
    aabcccccaaa => a2b1c5a3

Possible Solutions
    character_count = 1
    current_character = set to first character in string
    compressed_string = ''
    for the length of string
        pick a character at current index
            compare character with current_character
                if same
                    increment character_count by 1
                if not
                    append current_character and character_count to character_count
                    set character_count to 1
                    set current_character = character

Walk through
    string length = 10
    current_character = a
    character_count = 3
    compressed_string = a2b1c5a3

    Performance
        P = length of original string
        K = number of consecutive character sequences

        Time = O(P + K^2)
                K^2 because string concatenation is O(N^2)
                For each character sequence
                    we copy the compressed version and the current character sequence compression
                        into a new compressed string

                Why is concatenation O(N^2)?
                    X = length of current string
                    N = number of strings

                    1st iteration = 1X copy
                    2nd iteration = 2X copy
                    3rd iteration = 3X copy
                    Nth iteration = NX copy

                    O(1X + 2X + 3X ... NX) => O(N^2)

        Space = O(2P) => O(P)
            Compressed string might be twice as long
