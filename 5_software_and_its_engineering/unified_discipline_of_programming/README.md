# What is Computer Programming?
objectives:
- attempts to define computer programming as a unified discipline.
- a study of computer programming independent of programming languages.

def computer programming: the act of extending or
                    changing a system's functionality (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xv).
- practitioners:
   - general users: by changing the setting of an alarm
   - expert users: by writing new features for the system or updating existing

- example:
   - extending a system's functionality:
      - writing a new application for iOS

   - changing a system's functionality:
      - moving iOS from using 4 digits to 7 digits passwords

def computation model: formal system, that defines how computations are done (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xiii).
- it provides a programming model.
   - def programming model: programming techniques AND design principles,
                              made possible AND used by a computation model
      - def programming techniques: TBD
      - def design principles: TBD 

- it is based on a kernel language:
   - def kernel language: core language a computation model is based on (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xiv)

- it defined in terms of (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xiii):
   - data types
   - operations
   - a programming language 
   
   **NB** there are other ways to define computation models.
