def:
    bypass authorisation checks in order to gain access to protected resourcers

causes: 
    occurs when a reference to an internal objects(e.g file, database) is exposed externally through links,
        parameter values, etc.

    if there is no authorisation to access the internal objects, they can be manipulated to access unauthorised data

solutions:
    use per user or per session indirect references
    implement access control checks to resources referenced
    never rely on user defined input parameters (e.g to GET, POST methods, cookies, HTTP headers etc) to authorise access to senstive resources
    always rely on server side session information to authorise access to senstive resources and use mapping vlues to acccess objects
    all private pages should be protected using authorisation - use centralised authorisation techniques
    no two separate pieces of code should verify if an acccount belongs to a certain user
        use one authorisation implementation?
