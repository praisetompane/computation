Python programs are read by a parser
    the parsers accepts a stream of tokens as input (Python Software Foundation, 2023).

Python Lexical Analysis (Python Software Foundation, 2023):
    Line structure:
        Python programs are divided into logical lines.
            defs:
                - logical line:
                    denoted by NEWLINE(\n) token.
                    constructed from one or more physical lines
                        following explicit and implicit line joining rules.
                    statements do not cross logical lines.
                        exceptions = {if the statement's syntax allows NEWLINEs}
                            e.g. compound statement: if..else

                - physical line:
                    -denoted by end-of-line sequence.
                        - supported sequences:
                            LF = Line Feed
                            CR = Carriage Return
                            CRLF = Carriage Return Line Feed
                    implicitly denoted by end of input.
                - blank lines:
                - explicit line joining:
                - implicit line joining:
                - indentation:
                - comments:
                    - starts at beginning of logical line with a hash character(#).
                        the # must NOT be part of string literal.
                    - finishes at the end of physical.
                    - signify end of logical line
                        unless implicit line joining rules are invoked.
                    - ignored by the syntax.
                - encoding declarations:
                - white spaces between tokens:
