Python programs are read by a parser
    the parser accepts a stream of tokens as input (Python Software Foundation, 2023).

Lexical analyzer: generates stream of tokens from Python program text (Python Software Foundation, 2023)
    for the parser.

Python program text is read as Unicode code points.
    SyntaxError is raised if file cannot be decoded (Python Software Foundation, 2023).

def: python lexical analysis(Python Software Foundation, 2023):
    - line structure:
        Python programs are divided into logical lines.
        see for details: src/1_lexical_analysis/1_line_structure 
        
    - identifiers and keywords
    - literals
    - operators
    - delimiters
    - other tokens      

def tokens(Python Software Foundation, 2023):

    categories:
        Q: categories = token names in the form <token_name, identifier> generated by the lexer?
        - NEWLINE
        - INDENT
        - DEDENT
        - identifiers (names)
        - keywords
        - literals
        - operators
        - delimiters

    whitespace characters are NOT tokens:
        - exceptions
            - NEWLINE (\n)
            - end-of-line sequence
                - linefeed (LF)
                - return (CR)
                - return linefeed (CR LF)
        - they delineate tokens

    ambiguity resolution rule:
        the longest string of characters
        from left to right
            that form a valid token
                is the token extracted from the program text.
