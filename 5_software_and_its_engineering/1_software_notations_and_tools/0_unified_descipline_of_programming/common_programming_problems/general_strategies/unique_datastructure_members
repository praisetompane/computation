objective: define generic algorithm to determine if members of a datastructure are ALL unique.

1. create empty seen_hashtable
2. for member in collection #this traversal depends on the datastructure, i.e. array, tree etc
        if member in seen_hashtable: False
        else: add member to seen_hashtable
