approach to a unified  discipline of programming

def programming: the act of extending or
                    changing a system's functionality (Van Roy, Haridi S. 2004:xv).

                    performed by general users and experts
                        general users by changing the setting of an alarm
                        expert users by writing new features for the system or updating existing

                example: extending a system's functionality:
                            - writing a new application for iOS

                         changing a system's functionality:
                            - moving iOS from using 4 digit to 7 digits passwords

def computation model: formal system, that defines how computations are done.
                            computation model provides a programming model.

def programming model: programming techniques AND design principles,
                            made possible AND used by a computation model
