# What is Software?

objective: unpack in layman's terms what computer programming and software are and their role in the current implementation of computation.

def software (Scott, 2009:109): a term to differentiate the computer 
                                from the state of the bits in the computer.
              
                                software is the state of the bits.

                                NB: the bit itself is hardware.
