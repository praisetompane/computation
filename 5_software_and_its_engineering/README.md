# What is Software?

**objective**: unpack in layman's terms what computer programming, software and software engineering are and their role in the current implementation of computation.

**def software¹**: a term to differentiate the computer 
                                from the state of the bits in the computer (Scott, 2009:109).
              
**def software²**: state of the bits.
- **NB**: the bit itself is hardware.

**def software³ (Scott, 2009: 109)**: a package of computer Instruction Code. <br>
