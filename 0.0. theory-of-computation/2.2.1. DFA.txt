Formal defintion
    Every DFA can be described using the below attributes/components
        (Q, Σ, q0, F, δ ) 
            
        
        Q = Set of all states
        Σ = inputs
        q0 = (q subscript zero) = start state/initial state
        F = Set of final states
            at least one
        δ = del = transition function = Q X Σ => Q
            transition function that maps (Q X Σ) to Q

Diagrammatic representation of Components
    States
        Initial - required
            arrow coming in from nowhere pointing to state
        Final - required
            two circles
        Rest of states = circle
    Edges
        pointed arrow
        label = input = defined in Σ
        Transition function
