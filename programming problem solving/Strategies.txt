0. Can the incoming data structure be used to solve the problem?
    Is there a solution inherent in the structure itself already?

    e.g. repeated string problem

1. Can you rearrange the data in to a structure more suitable for the problem?

    e.g. SockMerchant.txt
    https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sock-merchant/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=warmup


PATH PROBLEMS?
    Path finding
    Counting "events/things" in a path

2. Walk the problem space while simultaneously solving the problem
    as opposed to mapping out the whole problem space then solving the problem

    e.g. 
    JumpingOnTheClouds.txt
    https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/jumping-on-the-clouds/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=warmup


    CountingValleys.txt

    ARRAYS
3.  Compute the final state without walking the whole path step by step
    i.e. Avouid O(N) implementation
    
    e.g. ArrayLeftRotation.txt
    
    https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-array-left-rotation/copy-from/75481377?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D%5B%5D=arrays&isFullScreen=true
