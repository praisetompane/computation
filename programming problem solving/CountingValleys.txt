Mountain = consecutive steps above sea level
           starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.

Valley = sequence
            consecutive steps 
                below sea level
            starting
                step down from sea level 
            ending 
                with a step up to sea level.

Given Gary's sequence of up and down steps during his last hike
    Find number of valleys
        he walked through

Key
    U = uphill step
    D = downhill step

Start of hike = sea level
End of hike = sea level

Count valleys
For whole queue
    Extract step
        if step == U, stepsBelowSeaLevel -=1
        if step == D && stepsBelowSeaLevel == 0, stepsBelowSeaLevel +=1

        if step == D, stepsBelowSeaLevel +=1
