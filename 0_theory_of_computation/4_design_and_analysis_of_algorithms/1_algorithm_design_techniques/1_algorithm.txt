def algorithm¹ (Demaine, Ku, Solomon, 2020):
    - formal:
            let:
                𝐼 = set of inputs
                𝑂 = set of outputs
            then:
                𝑓: 𝐼 ↦ 𝑂

        - in words: a function from a set of inputs to outputs.

    - plain english: a finite procedure
                        that maps
                            an input
                            to a single output.

    - intuition:
        - algorithms are just a sequence of steps "to do something"
            "to do something", you need:
                store and name things = variables/values(see point 2)
                decisions = if, else
                repeat = iteration constructs = loops, recursion

    - properties:
        - repository of algorithms: https://github.com/algorithm-archivists/algorithm-archive
        - etymology: eponym of Al-Khawarizmi.

    - examples: ???

    - use cases: ???

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
