def¹: a finite procedure
        that maps
            an input
            to a single output (Demaine, Ku, Solomon, 2020).
        i.e.a function f: Input -> Output.
            a solution to a computational problem.

def²: a recipe for solving a specific problem by manipulating symbols (Wengrow, 2017:56).

def³: a computational procedure for solving a problem (Demaine, 2017)
    i.e. input -> algorithm -> output

plain english:
    - algorithms are just a sequence of steps "to do something"
        "to do something", you need:
            store and name things = variables/values(see point 2)
            decisions = if, else
            repeat = iteration constructs = loops, recursion
