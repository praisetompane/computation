What is it?
    A point in time and space in a computer
        where you can store values

    Fundamental data structure that all the data structures are built on top of.

Performance Analysis:
    How fast is it to peform the operation? (i.e. Time Complexity)
        => Measured in terms of the number of steps it takes to complete the operation

    Read: Looking up something from a particular spot in the datastructure
        Steps = 1
        O(1)
    
    Search: Looking for a particular value in te datastructure
        Steps = 1
        O(1)

    Insert: Adding a value to the datastructure 
        Steps = 1
        O(1)

    Delete: Removing a value from the datastructure
        Steps = 1
        O(1)
