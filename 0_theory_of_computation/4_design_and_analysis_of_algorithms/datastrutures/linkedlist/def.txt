What is it?
    A variable length
        list of values 
        with explicit links between the values

Concepts related to it:
    Node = a container for the value and the explicit link

Performance Analysis:
    How fast is it to peform the operation? (i.e. Time Complexity)
        => Measured in terms of the number of steps it takes to complete the operation
