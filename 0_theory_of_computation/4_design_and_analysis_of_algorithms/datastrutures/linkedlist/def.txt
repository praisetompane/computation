What is it?
    A variable length
        list of values 
        with explicit links between the values (Wengrow, 2017:141).

Concepts related to it:
    Node = a container for the value and the explicit link

Performance Analysis (Wengrow, 2017:144-150):
    How fast is it to perform the operation? (i.e. Time Complexity)
        => Measured in terms of the number of steps it takes to complete the operation

        Steps = 
            Head of list = 1 step = O(1)
            Rest of list = N steps to value = 𝑂(𝑁)
    
    Search: Looking for a particular value in Te data structure

    Insert: Adding a value to the data structure 
        Steps = 
            Head of list = 2 steps to reappoint pointers = O(1)
            Bottom of list = N steps to last value + 1 step to appoint last value's next = 𝑂(𝑁) + O(1) = 𝑂(𝑁)

    Delete: Removing a value from the data structure
        Steps = 
            Head of list = 2 steps to reappoint pointers = O(1)
            Rest of list = N steps to last value + 1 step to appoint last value's next = 𝑂(𝑁) + O(1) = 𝑂(𝑁)
