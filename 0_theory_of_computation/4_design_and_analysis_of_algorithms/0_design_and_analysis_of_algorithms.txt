    - properties:
        - solution flow: problem_solving_techniques/1_solution_flow.txt
        - steps:
            1. develop solution:
                1.1. reduce to a problem we know how to solve(use a data structure or algorithm):
                    - search problem (use data structures)

                1.2. design your own (recursive) algorithm:

                    remark: algorithm will be recursive in nature(so we can use induction to prove correctness)
            2. prove solution correctness:
                - techniques:
                    - induction
            3. argue efficiency:
                - techniques:
                    - asymptotic analysis
    - examples: ???

    - use cases: ???

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
