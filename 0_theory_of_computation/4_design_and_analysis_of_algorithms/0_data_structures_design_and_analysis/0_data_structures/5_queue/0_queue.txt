def queue(Wengrow, 2017:153-157):
    - formal:
        - ADT:
            - enqueue
            - dequeue
            - peek
            - isempty

        - in words: a variable length list of values that only supports,
                        adding elements to the end of the list: enqueue
                        removing element at the top of the list: dequeue
                        reading element at the top of the list

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: a First In, First Out(FIFO) access pattern over a sequence of values.

    - properties:
        - performance analysis:
            - How fast is it to perform the operation? (i.e. Time Complexity)
                => Measured in terms of the number of steps it takes to complete the operation

            Read: Looking up something from a particular spot in the data structure
                Steps = 1 step = O(1)
                        NB: The interface only supports accessing the top element.
                            Therefore you only look up the top value.

            Search: Looking for a particular value in the data structure
                Steps = N/A. The interface only supports accessing the top element.

            Insert: Adding a value to the structure
                Steps = 2 steps to reappoint pointers = O(1)

            Delete: Removing a value from the data structure
                Steps = Steps = 2 steps to reappoint pointers = O(1)

    - examples: ???

    - use cases:
        - processing data in the order it was received
            - handling asynchronous requests
            - modelling patients for the doctor
            - modelling planes waiting to take off

    - proof: ???
