def stack(Wengrow, 2017:145):
    - formal:
        - ADT:
            - push
            - pop
            - peek
            - isempty

        - in words: a variable length list of values that only supports,
                        - adding elements to the top of the list
                        - removing element at the top of the list
                        - reading element at the top of the list

    - plain english: ???

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - access pattern: Last In, First Out = LIFO
        - performance analysis:
            How fast is it to perform the operation? (i.e. Time Complexity)
                => Measured in terms of the number of steps it takes to complete the operation

            Read: Looking up something from a particular spot in the data structure
                Steps =  1 step = O(1)
                        NB: The interface only supports accessing the top element.
                            Therefore you only look up the top value.

            Search: Looking for a particular value in the data structure
                Steps = N/A. The interface only supports accessing the top element.

            Insert: Adding a value to the data structure
                Steps = 2 steps to reappoint pointers = O(1)

            Delete: Removing a value from the data structure
                Steps = 2 steps to reappoint pointers = O(1)

    - examples: ???

    - use cases:
        - operations tracker:
            - undo
            - redo
        - order_reversal
        - symmetry validator

    - proof: ???
