def data structures (Wengrow, 2017:27):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: how data is organized

    - intuition: 
        - data structures are just how you store things.
                 to store something, you need:
                    - place to store it = array index, node in a list, leave in a tree etc
                    - a way to retrieve = access patterns = LIFO, FIFO etc

        - ways to store a non-constant amount of data
            to make operations on that data faster (Demaine, Ku, Solomon, 2020).

    - properties: ???

    - examples: ???

    - use cases: ???
        
    - proof: ???
