        - in words: ???

    - plain english:
        - Performance:
            How fast is it to perform the operation? (i.e. Time Complexity)
                => Measured in terms of the number of steps it takes to complete the operation

            - Read: Looking up something from a particular spot in the data-structure
                Steps =

            - Search: Looking for a particular value in the data-structure

                - Breadth First Search:
                    - Starting at a node
                        explore all its neighbours
                        before moving on the next node(to explore all its neighbours)
                    - Steps = O(V)

                - Depth First Search:
                    - Starting at a node
                        explore each branch completely
                        before moving on to next branch(to explore it completely)

                    - Steps = O(V)

            - Insert: Adding a value to the data-structure
                Steps =

            - Delete: Removing a value from the data-structure
                Steps =

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

    - examples: ???

    - use cases:
        - Visit every node in graph => BFS and DFS
            remarks: DFS simpler for this

        - Determine path between two nodes (or shortest path) => BFS
            - BFS to find an answer, first interrogates ALL neighbours of a node X,
                thus takes the shortest path to answering the question
                    as it relates to X
            - DFS to find an answer, explores an increasingly narrower branch of the graph rooted at node X
                hence reduces the probability of find the answer, per search attempt
                    Because it narrows down search space, per attempt
