Equality
    Total order
        antisymmetry: v <= w and w <= v then v == w, 
                      because v <= w and w <= v describes a symmetrical relationship, 
                      therefore v has to be equal w

        transitivity: v <= w and w <= x, then v <= x

        totality: either v <= w or w <=v or both(i.e v <= w and w <= v, therefore v = w)
