def automata theory(Sipser, 2012:2):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: theory that deals with definitions and properties of mathematical models of computation.

    - intuition: provides mathematical models of computers(i.e. computation or algorithms)

    - properties:
        - models of computation:
            - finite automaton
            - context-free grammar
            - turing machines
            - lambda calculus
            - probabilistic and interactive computation
            - ...

    - examples: ???

    - use cases:
        - Computability and Complexity theory use its models of computation(i.e. model of a computer) to
            study properties of computation.

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
