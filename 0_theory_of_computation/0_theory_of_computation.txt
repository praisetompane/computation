def theory of computation(Sipser, 2012:1):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: attempts to answer the question: "What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?(i.e. computation or algorithms)".

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - topic relationship (Yanofsky, 2021):
            1_formal_languages_and_automata_theory: defines computers and languages they understand.
                                |
                                |
                                V
            2_models_of_computation: defines ways to compute and what our computers can/cannot compute.
                                |     defines how to do/run a list of steps AND
                                |       which lists of steps we can/can't do/run.
                                V
            3_computational_complexity_and_cryptography: defines the time and space/memory required to compute.
                                |                         defines how much time and space is required
                                |                           to do/run a list of steps.
                                V
            4_design_and_analysis_of_algorithms: defines how to make effective and efficient computations.

    - examples: ???

    - use cases: ???

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
