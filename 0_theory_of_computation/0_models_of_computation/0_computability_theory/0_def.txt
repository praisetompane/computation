def: theory to classify problems into two categories (Sipser, 2012:3):
    - SOLVABLE by computers 
    - NOT SOLVABLE by computers

Examples (Sipser. 2012:2):
    Proof that a mathematical statement is True or False: NOT SOLVABLE.
    Add two numbers 1 + 5: SOLVABLE.

Q: Can define new models of computation that can compute the current incomputable(UNSOLVABLE) problems?
