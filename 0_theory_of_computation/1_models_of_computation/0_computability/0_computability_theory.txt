def computability theory(Sipser, 2012:3):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: theory to classify problems into the two categories below:
            - SOLVABLE by computers (i.e. Computable)
            - NOT SOLVABLE by computers (i.e. Incomputable)

    - intuition: ???

    - properties: ???

    - examples:
        - classification of problems (Sipser. 2012:2):
            - add two numbers 1 + 5: SOLVABLE = computable
            - prove that a mathematical statement is True or False: NOT SOLVABLE = incomputable

    - use cases: ???
        
    - proof: None. It is a field.
    
    - remarks:
        - development timeline: 1930 - 1950
        
    Q: Can define new models of computation that can compute the current incomputable(UNSOLVABLE) problems?
