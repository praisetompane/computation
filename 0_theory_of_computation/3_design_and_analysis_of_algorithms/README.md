# 3_design_and_analysis_of_algorithms

unpack what algorithms & data structures are and their role in the implementation of computation

# What is an Algorithm?
def algorithm: algorithms are just a sequence of steps "to do something"
    "to do something", you need:
        store and name things = variables/values(see point 2)
        decisions = if, else
        repeat = iteration constructs = loops, recursion

formal def: a recipe for solving a specific problem by manipulating symbols (Wengrow, 2017:56).

# What is a Data Structure?
def data structure: data structures are just how you store things
    to store something, you need:
        place to store it = array index, node in a list, leave in a tree etc
        a way to retrieve = access patterns = LIFO, FIFO etc

formal def: how data is organised (Wengrow, 2017:27).
