# algorithms_and_data_structures

unpack what algorithms & data structures are and their role in the implementation of computation.

* algorithm => Algorithms are just a sequence of steps "to do something"
    "to do something", you need:
        store and name things = variables/values(see point 2)
        decisions = if, else
        repeat = iteration constructs = loops, recursion

    formal def: a recipe for solving a specific problem by manipulating symbols (Wengrow, 2017:56).

* data structure => Data Structures are just how you store things
    to store something, you need:
        place to store it = array index, node in a list, leave in a tree etc
        a way to retrieve = access patterns = LIFO, FIFO etc

    formal def: how data is organised (Wengrow, 2017:27).

* example building the array data structure is below
```zsh
    $ cd src/array
    $ make test-program
    $ ./test-program
