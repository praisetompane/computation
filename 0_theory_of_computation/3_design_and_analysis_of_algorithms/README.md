# 3_design_and_analysis_of_algorithms

objective:
    - unpack in layman's terms what algorithms & data structures are and their role in the humanity's current implementation of computation.
    - solve computational problems.
    - prove correctness of solutions.
    - argue efficiency.

## What is a Computational Problem?
def: a binary relation between a set of inputs and outputs (Demaine, Ku, Solomon, 2020).

# What is an Algorithm?
def¹: a recipe for solving a specific problem by manipulating symbols (Wengrow, 2017:56).
def²: f: I -> O
        I = input domain
        O = output codomain 
        a function from a a set of inputs to a set of valid outputs(Demaine, Ku, Solomon, 2020).

defᵖˡᵃⁱⁿ_ᵉⁿᵍˡⁱˢʰ: algorithms are just a sequence of steps "to do something"
    "to do something", you need:
        store and name things = variables/values(see point 2)
        decisions = if, else
        repeat = iteration constructs = loops, recursion

# What is a Data Structure?
def¹: how data is organised (Wengrow, 2017:27).

defᵖˡᵃⁱⁿ_ᵉⁿᵍˡⁱˢʰ: data structures are just how you store things
    to store something, you need:
        place to store it = array index, node in a list, leave in a tree etc
        a way to retrieve = access patterns = LIFO, FIFO etc
