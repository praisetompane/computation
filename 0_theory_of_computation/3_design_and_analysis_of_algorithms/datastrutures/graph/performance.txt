How fast is it to perform the operation? (i.e. Time Complexity)
    => Measured in terms of the number of steps it takes to complete the operation

Read: Looking up something from a particular spot in the data-structure
    Steps = 


Search: Looking for a particular value in the data-structure

    Breadth First Search
        Starting at a node
            explore all its neighbours
            before moving on the next node(to explore all its neighbours)
        Steps = O(V)

    Depth First Search
        Starting at a node
            explore each branch completely
            before moving on to next branch(to explore it completely)
        
        Steps = O(V)

    Best Suited Use Cases
        Visit every node in graph => BFS and DFS
            NB: DFS simpler for this
        
        Determine path between two nodes (or shortest path) => BFS
            BFS to find an answer, first interrogates ALL neighbours of a node X,
                thus takes the shortest path to answering the question
                    as it relates to X
            DFS to find an answer, explores an increasingly narrower branch of the graph rooted at node X
                hence reduces the probability of find the answer, per search attempt
                    Because it narrows down search space, per attempt

    Example:
        0: 1, 3
        1: 3, 4
