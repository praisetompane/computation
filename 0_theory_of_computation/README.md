# 0_theory_of_computation

**objective**: unpack the theoretical foundations of computation. 

**def theory of computationÂ¹:** <br>
- formal:
    

- plain english:
    - attempts to answer the question: "What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?"(Sipser. 2012:1).



- intuition:
    - 2_formal_languages_and_automata_theory: defines computers and languages they understand.

    - 1_models_of_computation: defines ways to compute and what our computers can/cannot compute.

    - 3_computational_complexity_and_cryptography: 
        - defines the time and space/memory required to compute.
        - defines how much time and space is required to do/run a list of steps.
                        
    - 4_design_and_analysis_of_algorithms: defines how to make effective and efficient computations.
