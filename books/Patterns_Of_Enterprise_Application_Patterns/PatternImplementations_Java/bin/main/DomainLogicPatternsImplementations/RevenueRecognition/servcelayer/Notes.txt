Define an application's BOUNDARY
    with A layer of services
        -> of available operations
        -> that coordinate responses in each operation

        for client layers (UI, Data loaders, integration gateways etc)
        and from the client layer's perspective

    Implementation approaches
        -> Thin Facade
        -> Operation script


Distinguishes "domain logic" (actual business logic, rules etx) and "application logic" (application responsibilities
                                such as notifying contract adminitrastors, integrated apps etc)

When: Multiple clients or second transactional resource


Note: This implementation uses Operation Script
