1. Algorithm and Coding problems
    Problem-solving questions


2. Expectations
    - 1 question in the interview (+- 45 minutes)
    - Think out loud
    - Explain thought process
    - Interviwer might jump in to help: LET THEM!! 
        - Doesn't mean you're doing poorly
        - ALWAYS BETTER TO NOT NEED THE HINTS

3. Outcome = Interviwer GUT FEEL for how you did, base on:
            Analytical skills
            Coding skills
            Technical
            Experience
            Culture 

            It's not quantitative

4. Why? - Company's perspective
    - False positives are acceptable
    - Problem Solving skills are valuable
    - Basic data structure and algorithm knowledge is useful
    - Whiteboards let you focuc on what matters

5. Question selection
    Interviwer discretion - No recent Google/Amazon question

6. It's all relative
    - You're compared to all the people the interviewer has seen that week and has ever seen.
