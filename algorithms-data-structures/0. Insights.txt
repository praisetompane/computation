1. Algorithms are just a sequence of steps "to do something"
    "to do something", you need:
        store and name things = variables/values(see point 2)
        decisionss = if, else
        repeat = iteration constructs = loops, recursion

2. Data Structures are just how you store things
    to store something, you need:
        place to store it = array index, node in a list, leave in a tree etc
        a way to retrieve = access patterns = LIFO, FIFO etc
