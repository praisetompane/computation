Sorting
    Bubble sort => 
        swap the number highest/lowest number to the end(bubble it up)

    Insertion sort => 
        pick number and insert into correct position in target list
        shuffle numbers in target array if necessary

    Selection sort =>
        divide array into two conceptual parts
            sorted
            unsorted
        find smallest/highest
        swap it into the next index in the sorted array(with the number currently there)

        characteristics = 
            minimum swaps
            high comparisons : each number compared to each number in unsorted section

Data Structure points of analysis
    Speed and efficiency : Big O analysis
        array
        set
        hash table
    Code elegance and maintability
            stack
            queue
        These two are perfect for handling temporay data
        Handle data in an order
        Discard data when done
