What is it?
    A variable length
        list of values 

        that only supports
            adding elements to the top of the list
            removing element at the top of the list
            reading element at the top of the list

    Therefore: An access pattern for a list of values
    i.e. LIFO = Last In, First Out

ADT
    push
    pop
    peek
    isempty 
    
Performance Analysis:
    How fast is it to peform the operation? (i.e. Time Complexity)
        => Measured in terms of the number of steps it takes to complete the operation

    Read: Looking up something from a particular spot in the datastructure
        Steps = 
            2 step = O(1)
    
    Search: Looking for a particular value in te datastructure
        Steps = 

    Insert: Adding a value to the datastructure 
        Steps = 
            2 steps to reappoint pointers = O(1)

    Delete: Removing a value from the datastructure
        Steps = 
            4 steps to reappoint pointers = O(1)
