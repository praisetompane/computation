# 1_algorithms_and_data_structures
# definitions
* objective =>  build from stratch the stack of classic data structures and algorithms using the C programming language.
This is for educational purposes as I unpack this layer of computation.

* algorithm => Algorithms are just a sequence of steps "to do something"
    "to do something", you need:
        store and name things = variables/values(see point 2)
        decisionss = if, else
        repeat = iteration constructs = loops, recursion

    formal def: a recipe for solving a specific problem by manipulating symbols

* datatructure => Data Structures are just how you store things
    to store something, you need:
        place to store it = array index, node in a list, leave in a tree etc
        a way to retrieve = access patterns = LIFO, FIFO etc
# testing
* testing framework: https://github.com/jmmv/atf/

# how to use
* navigate to datastructure's folder
* navigate into test folder
* run make

* example building the array datastructure is below
```zsh
    $ cd src/array
    $ make test-program
    $ ./test-program
```
