Chapter: What the...
    A CRAZY LIGHTING SYSTEM (With TWO swicthes)
        -> If BOTH swicthes are ON the light is OFF
        -> If BOTH swicthes are OFF the light is ON
        -> If either swicth is OFF the light is ON

    GATE
        This is the fundamental device needed to build a Computer, BUT you need a lot of them
        Device that has connections to:
            2 input wires
            1 output wire

            The wires are bits as defined above

        It is also connected to two wires
            -> one wire is connected to a place where electricity is always ON 
            -> one wire is connected to a place where electricity is always OFF
        
        The state of the 1 output bit is determined by the 2 input bits according to the the 'A CRAZY LIGHTING SYSTEM' above


        Types of gates

            -> (Negative AND) NAND gate => The base gate on which all gates are built: It uses the 'A CRAZY LIGHTING SYSTEM' above
                   a     b     c
                | on  | on  | off |
                | on  | off | on  |
                | off | on  | on  |
                | off | off | on  |                

            -> NOT gate => tie the a and b wires together of the NAND so they'are always the same
                           they can still be turned on or off but can NEVER be different, they're either both on or off

                Verbose version
                       a     b     c
                    | on  | on  | off |
                    | off | off | on  |

                Simplified version (since a is equal to b {apply arithmetic here})
                       a     c
                    | on  | off |
                    | off | on  |

            -> AND gate => combination of the NAND + NOT gate
           
                Verbose version
                        a     b    x     c
                    | on  | on  | off | on  |
                    | on  | off | on  | off |
                    | off | on  | on  | off |
                    | off | off | on  | off |     

                Simplified version
                    Since the 'x' bit is not available to be connected (says the book : I say it is available, the NOT gate is connecting to it?)
                       a     b    c
                    | on  | on  | on  |
                    | on  | off | off |
                    | off | on  | off |
                    | off | off | off |

                The 'AND' word usage in Computers
                    - adjective => this is an 'AND' gate
                    - verb => let's 'AND' these two bits 

        Symbol meaning
            The 'D' means to the AND function => take action if both inputs are on
            The 'o' (little circle) means swicth to the opposite
            The '/\' triangle of the NOT gate means take an input and turn it into an output
