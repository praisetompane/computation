def:
    availability: percentage of time a system is operational
    reliability: probability of the percentage of time a system will be operational.

    pratical example:
        Given:
            total_hours := 8 
            system_unoperational_hours := 1
            system_operational_hours := total_hours - system_unoperational_hours
        Then
            availability := system_operational_hours/total_hours = 7/8 = 0.875 = 86%

            Given:
                availability above consistent over 1 year

            reliability := P(System Operational) = ???
