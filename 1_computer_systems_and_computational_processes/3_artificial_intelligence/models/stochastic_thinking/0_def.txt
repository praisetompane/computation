def method to model and handle uncertainty in computation models in which
    we are modelling and trying to understand the real world(which is unceratin) or a world with uncertainty.

CONTRAST: In classical programming we encode a set of deterministic rules, for a 
                world(domain) that are creating.
                rules:{logic, expected data,...}
                In the event of an invocation of the process that violdates the rules, we fail gracefully.

CONTRAST: def deterministic process: process that given the same input produces the same output.³ 

def stochastic process: process in which the output can depend on a random element.⁴
    properties:
        usualy uncertain output
        ∴ use PROBABILISTIC STATEMENTS to describe the possibe output 
                            
        Example specification:
            def roll_dice():"""return an int between 1 and 6"""
                Underdetermined specification  
                    do not neccessarily know the next value BUT does NOT have REQUIRE randomness
                    Can return:
                        a different value each roll
                        return the same value each roll
                
            def roll_dice(): """return a randomly chosen int between 1 and 6"""
                Stochastic specification
                    REQUIRES a random value to be returned each call
            
            Refer to "0_roll_dice.py" for example implementation of both specs
    Example:
        Given a coin
            That can be HEADs or TAILS
        1 Coin flip = 1 character sequence of result
            character sequence = x
            probability of character being Heads = 1/2 = 0.5
            probability of character being Tails = 1/2 = 0.5

        2 Coin flips = 2 character sequence of result
            character sequence = xx

            probability of 1ˢᵗ character being Heads = 1/2 = 0.5
            probability of 1ˢᵗ character being Tails = 1/2 = 0.5
                probability of 1ˢᵗ character's value = 1/2
                    1 = count of event
                    2 = all possible events = Heads or Tails
 
            probability of 2ⁿᵈ character being Heads = 1/2 = 0.5
            probability of 2ⁿᵈ character being Tails = 1/2 = 0.5
                probability of 1ˢᵗ character's value = 1/2
                    1 = count of event
                    2 = all possible events = Heads or Tails

            probability of any character sequence = 
                probability of 1ˢᵗ character's value(Heads or Tails) * 
                probability of 2ⁿᵈ character's value(Heads or Tails) * 
                probability of 3ʳᵈ character's value(Heads or Tails) * ... 
                probability of nᵗʰ character's value(Heads or Tails)

            ∴ for 2 coin flips
                probability of any sequence = 0.5*0.5 = 0.25 
                    probability rule applied here = multiply probability of independent events
                        to get probability of both happening

                        Q: What if the events(values) were NOT independent? => Use Conditional Probability
                            as opposed to Discrete Probability applied above?
                            
                Another representation:
                    1/2² = 0.25
                    1 = count of event were looking for(i.e. one specific unique sequence(e.g. Tails, Tails))
                    2² = all possible events

def indepedent event:
    an event is indepedent if its outcome IS NOT dependent of th results of previous result(s)
