Main Regions and Notable landmarks of the Continent of Machine Learning¹:

    Are they trained with/without human supervision and what type of supervision?
        S1: Supervised Learning
        S2: Unsupervised Learning
        S3: Semi-Supervised Learning
        S4: Reinforcement Learning

    Can they learn incrementally on the fly(i.e. real time)?
        I1: Batch Learning
        I2: Online Learning 

    Do they wpok by just matching new points to known points or identify patterns in training data to build a predicitive model(like scientists)?
        P1: Instance Based Learning
        P2:  Model Based Learning
