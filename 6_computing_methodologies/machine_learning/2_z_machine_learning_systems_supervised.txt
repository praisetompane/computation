def: algorithm is given training data 
    with labelled instances
        (i.e. labels say what the instance is)
        Example: Spam or Ham email, Cat or Dog, Number or Letter, etc

def instance: a manifestation of class of object

def class: a category
    Example: Cat

Typical use cases:
    classification:
        training data instances are labelled with a "class"

    regression: 
        using a set of features(predictors) to predict a TARGET NUMERIC value.
        can also be used for classification(e.g. logistic regression)

def attribute: a property/datatype of an object
    height (for a person)
    cylinders (for an engine)

def feature(common): an attribute and its value
    height = 180cm
    cylinders = 6


Important Algorithms:
    - K-Nearest neighbour
    - Linear Regression
    - Logistic Regression
    - Support Vector Machines
    - Decision Trees and Random Forests
    - Neural Networks(can also be unsupervised)
