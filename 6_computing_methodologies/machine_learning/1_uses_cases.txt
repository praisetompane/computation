UC 1:
    Traditional Email Spam Flagging Programming Implementation¹

        1. Identify patterns in Spam email.
            Words/Phrases used = {4U, Credit Card, Winner, Lucky Day}

        2. Write rules to detect patterns identified(in step 1).
            Flag email as spam if certain number of these patterns detected.

        3. Test and repeat Step 1 and 2 until implementation works.

        Pros:
            Precise rules based on seen examples

        Cons:
            Long and complex rules list
                - difficult to:
                    - maintain
                    - update

        Flow:
                                                            Launch
                                                                ↑ Pass Testing
                                                                |
            Study The Problem --> Write The Rules --> Evaluate the Solution
                    ↑                                           |
                    |                                           ↓ Fail Testing
                    -------------Analyze The Errors--------------


    Machine Learning Email Spam Flagging Implementation²:

        1. Gather email data
            Ham email
            Spam email

        2. Train ML model to flag spam
            - ML model identifies spam email patterns

        3. Test and repeat Step 1 and 2 until implementation works

        Flow:

                                    Email Data             Launch
                                        |                      ↑ Pass Testing
                                        ↓                      |
            Study The Problem --> Train ML Model --> Evaluate the Solution
                        ↑                                      |
                        |                                      ↓ Fail Testing
                        ----------Analyze The Errors-----------

        Pros:
            Simpler Code
        Cons:
            Rules are known by model and NOT explicit(given the current state of the art ~2022-March-28)

        Flow: Automatically Adapting To Change ML Model³

Broad Classes OF Machine Learning Suitable Problems⁴:
    - UC1 : Problems which requires creating and updating long list of rules or hand-tuning to solve.
    - UC2: Complex Problems: Problems for which there is no good traditional programming solution.
        Speech Recognition
    - UC3: Fluctuating Environments: Problems for which the data is constantly changing.
    - UC4: Understanding complex problems or large volumes of data(i.e. data mining)
        - Some of the algorithms can be "unpacked" to see what they have "learned"
        - This can be used to study large amounts of data
