    We(humans) can see/know that the m=1 line underestimates the values.
    ∴ We increase m
      BUT how would a computer know to INCREASE or DECREASE m?
        mₙₑw = mcᵤᵣᵣₑₙₜ - k  d
                          ----- E(m)
                           d(m)

            ENGLISH: current slope minus
                some constant k multiplied
                    by the derivative of the error function

                    i.e. error functionE(m) = maps slope to sum of errors squared = error value
                        i.e. error value = how wrong/incorrect is the line's predictions compared
                            to the actual real world values
