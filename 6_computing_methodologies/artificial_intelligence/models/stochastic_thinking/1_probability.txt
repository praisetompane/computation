def probability: ???

Basic prbability facts
    - probabilities range from 0 to 1
        0 = is not probable
        1 = definitely probable
    - if an event has probability (p), the probability of it not happening is (1 - p) 
    - multiplicative law: if two events are indepedent
        the probability of the both events happening
        is the product
            of the prabilities of the events
            
        Example:
            Given 
                probability of
                    event A = 0.5 
                    event B = 0.4
            Probability of Event A and B
                A * B
                0.5 * 0.4
                0.2
                Note it is lower, which is expected.
                Q: Probability of both happening has to be lower, but WHY?
                
        Two events are independent if
            the result of one event does not affect 
                the result of the other one
