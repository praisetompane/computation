human language and word meaning:¹ 
    human language serves to connect humans in the "human network".
        human language = networking language
            slow network
    writing ~5000 years old

representation of meaning words³:
    def denotational semantics: defining what things(idea/meaning) represent 
        signifier(symbol) => signified(idea or thing)
    NB: Difficult to model computationally

    methods:
        - one-hot vectors
        - distributional semantics

Usable meaning in computation:
    1. nltk => old tool
    
traditional nlp(until ~2012):² 
    words = discrete symbols
    hotel, conference,motel - a LOCALIST representation

    meaning representation = one-hot vectors
    
neural network nlp³:
    mean representation = distributional semantics
