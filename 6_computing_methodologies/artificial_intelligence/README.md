# 7_artitificial_intelligence

unpack the use of computation in the implementation of artificial intelligence.

def: the science of giving computers the ability to act intelligently (Kepner, Gadepally, 2020).

**Disclaimer**: This is an ongoing and incomplete project to unpack these concepts and serve as my distributed memory.

## subsets (Kepner, Gadepally, 2020)

* Narrow AI: Theory and develpment of computing sytems that perform tasks that augment for human intelligence such perception, classification, reasoning, learning, abstracting and/or acting etc
* General AI: Theory and develpment of fully autonous computing sytems

## constraints:

* compute
* data
* generalisable knowledge and ability to encode it into algorithm

## four waves of AI (Kepner, Gadepally, 2020)

* Reasoning
* Learning
* Context
* Abstraction

Dimensions: - Reasoning - Learning - Abstracting - Reasoning

Contraints:
Compute power
Data(Size and Quality)
Ability to encode knowledge into algorithm

* Reasoning: Explicity define what the rules of a domain are.
  * Perceiving: Low
  * Learning: None
  * Abstracting: None
  * Reasoning: High
* Learning: Learn what the rules of a domain could be from data.
  domain = {language processing, investor transacting, ... }
  * Perceiving: High
  * Learning: High
  * Abstracting: Low
  * Reasoning: Low
* Context: System can add context into what it is doing.
  * Perceiving: High
  * Learning: Mid
  * Abstracting: High
  * Reasoning: High
* Abstraction: Abstract and transfer knowledge from one domain to and apply in another.
  * Perceiving: High
  * Learning: High
  * Abstracting: High
  * Reasoning: High
