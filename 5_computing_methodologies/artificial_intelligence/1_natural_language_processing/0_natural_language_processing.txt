def natural language processing¹:


representation of the meaning of words(Manning, 2019):
    def denotational semantics: defining what things(idea/meaning) represent 
        signifier(symbol) => signified(idea or thing)
    NB: Difficult to model computationally

    methods:
        - one-hot vectors
        - distributional semantics

Usable meaning in computation:
    1. nltk => old tool
    
traditional NLP(until ~2012)(Manning, 2019):
    words = discrete symbols
    hotel, conference, motel - a LOCALIST representation

    meaning representation = one-hot vectors
    
neural network NLP (Manning, 2019):
    mean representation = distributional semantics
