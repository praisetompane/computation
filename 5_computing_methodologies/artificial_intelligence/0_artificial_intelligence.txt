def artificial intelligence(Kepner, Gadepally, 2020):
    - formal: ???

        - in words: ???

    - plain english: the science of giving computers the ability to act intelligently

    - intuition: ???

    - properties:
        - subsets:
            - Narrow AI: Theory and develOpment of computing systems that perform tasks that augment for human intelligence such perception, classification, reasoning, learning, abstracting and/or acting etc.
            - General AI: Theory and develOpment of fully autonomous co  ting systems.

        - constraints:
            - compute
            - data(size and quality)
            - generalizable knowledge and ability to encode it into algorithm

        - four waves of AI:
            - Reasoning
            - Learning
            - Context
            - Abstraction

        - dimensions: - Reasoning - Learning - Abstracting - Reasoning:
            - Reasoning: ExplicitLy define what the rules of a domain are.
                - Perceiving: Low
                - Learning: None
                - Abstracting: None
                - Reasoning: High
            - Learning: Learn what the rules of a domain could be from data.
                domain = {language processing, investor transacting, ... }
                - Perceiving: High
                - Learning: High
                - Abstracting: Low
                - Reasoning: Low
            - Context: System can add context into what it is doing.
                - Perceiving: High
                - Learning: Mid
                - Abstracting: High
                - Reasoning: High
            - Abstraction: Abstract and transfer knowledge from one domain to and apply in another.
                - Perceiving: High
                - Learning: High
                - Abstracting: High
                - Reasoning: High

    - use cases: ???

    - proof: none. it is a definition.
