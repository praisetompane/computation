## A collection of notes I have gathered as I attempt to understand computation

Declarative knowledge = statement of facts
                    
Imperative knowledge = statement of how to do something


Alan Turing primitive operations to compute anything

    The operations below + magnetic tape => compute anything
    Operations:
        Move left
        Move right
        Read
        Write
        Scan 
        Do nothing
