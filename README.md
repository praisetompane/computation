# What is Computer Science?
def: the study of computation.

objective: unpack computer scienceÂ¹ and its relation to mathematics in layman's terms.

a formal classification scheme is maintained here: https://zbmath.org/classification/?q=cc%3A68
# Conceptual Overview:
* theory_of_computation
  * Know what you can and can't compute.
* programming_language_theory_and_formal_methods
  * define a language to express computations.
* algorithms_and_data_structures
  * know how to compute.
* computer_architecture_and_organisation
  * hardware
    * create physical implementations of Turing Machines.
  * systems_software
    * use programming language theory to create computations that run and manage the machines.
* networks
  * connect machines.
* software_engineering
  * use machines to build systems.
