## What is computation?

### An attempt at unpacking what computation is, and humanity's current implementation of computation.  
### Rough view of computation and applications
* theory of computation
    * define a language(formal language theory = FLT) to express computations
    * Know how fast you can compute
    * Know what you can and can't compute
* algorithms and datastructures
    * Know how to compute
    * proposition: every computation an algorithm
* hardware
    * use FLT to ask machines to compute
* operating systems
    * use FLT to create computations that manage the machine
* networking hardware
    * connect machines
* computer_systems_engineering
    * use machines to build systems
