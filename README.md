# What is Computing?
This repo is an attempt at unpacking in layman's terms what computation is, and humanity's current implementation of computation.

## What is Computation?

## In plain English:
* def: the study of computation.

def¹: the **transformation** of **sequences of symbols** by **precise rules**(Konrad, 2015:6)

* symbols = {1,0,\*,{,;,<,>,...}
* to be refined: precise rules
  * example sequences:
    * 11010
    * ;\*>{11}  
      i.e. any sequence of the valid symbols

def²: The **evolution process** of some environment, by a **sequence of "simple, local" steps** (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy).

## In plain English:
* def computation: a list of steps to do something.

* def compute: to do/run a computation.
