## What is computation?

This repo is an attempt at unpacking in layman's terms what computation is, and humanity's current implementation of computation.

**Disclaimer**: This is an ongoing and incomplete project to unpack these concepts.

def 1: the **transformation** of **sequences of symblos** by **precise rules**

- symbols = {1,0,\*,{,;,<,>,...}
- to be refined: precise rules
  - example sequences:
    - 11010
    - ;\*>{11}  
      i.e. any sequence of the validdi symbols

1. numerical computation
2. non-numerical computation

def 2: The evolution process of some enviroment, by a sequence of "simple, local" steps. _Church-Turing thesis_

## what computational questions can you ask object computational objects?

### Rough view of computation and applications

- theory of computation
  - define a language(formal language theory = FLT) to express computations
  - Know how fast you can compute
  - Know what you can and can't compute
- algorithms and datastructures
  - Know how to compute
  - proposition: every computation an algorithm
- hardware
  - use FLT to ask machines to compute
- operating systems
  - use FLT to create computations that manage the machine
- networking hardware
  - connect machines
- computer_systems_engineering
  - use machines to build systems
