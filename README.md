# What is Computation and Information?

objectives: 
  - an attempt at unpacking in layman's terms what is computation and information.
  - explore humanity's current implementation of computation.

def computation¹: the **transformation** of **sequences of symbols** by **precise rules**(Konrad, 2015:6)

* symbols = {1,0,\*,{,;,<,>,...}
  * example sequences:
    * 11010
    * ;\*>{11}  
      i.e. any sequence of the valid symbols
* precise rules = steps to follow


def computation²: The **evolution process** of some environment, by a **sequence of "simple, local" steps** (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy).

## In plain English:
* def computation: a list of steps to do something.

* def compute: to do/run a computation.
