# What are Computation and Information?
![build status](https://github.com/praisetompane/computation_and_information/actions/workflows/computation_and_information.yaml/badge.svg) <br>

## Objectives
- An attempt at unpacking in layman's terms what computation and information are.

## Definitions
- def computation¹: the **transformation** of **sequences of symbols** by **precise rules**(Konrad, 2015:6).

  - de symbols = {1,0,\*,{,;,<,>,...}
    - example sequences:
      - 11010
      - ;\*>{11}
        i.e. any sequence of the valid symbols
  - def precise rules = steps to follow

- def computation²: The **evolution process** of some environment, by a **sequence of "simple, local" steps** (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy).

- def computation: a list of steps to do something
- def compute: to do/run a computation.
- plain english: ???

- def information: ???
