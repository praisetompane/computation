WALKKING THROUGH A PROBLEM
    page 62

Preparation:
    - Try to solve the problems on your own - They're designed to be though, SO STRUUGLE with them
        Think about time and space complexity
    - Write code on paper
        - It is going to be slow
    - Test your code on paper
        base cases
        general cases
        worst cases?
        error cases
    - Type your code as is into a computer
        YOU WILL FIND MISTAKES, THAT'S OKAY IT WILL GET BETTER
        - Note down the mistakes for each problem
            - Keep them in mind for the next one

What you need to know(must have knowledge):
    be VERY VERY VERY comfortable with these.
    Practice implementing the DataStructures and Algorithms on paper then in computer

        DataStructures:
            7.1. DataStructures.txt

        Algorithms:
            7.2. Algorithms.txt

        Concepts:
            7.3. Concepts.txt
        
        FOR EACH TOPIC
            - Have Deep understanding
            - Know applications (How and When to use)
            - Time and Space complexity
