Be able to dynamically add behaviour to classes that is SIMILAR to other bavviours

When you want to define a class
    that will have behaviour
        that is similar to other behaviours
                in a list

Giving the class OBJECT the ability to choose behaviour
    For our example
        - Flying with wings
        - Not flying
        - Flying very fast

        Similarilty : All related to flight ability

How:

    Define a family of algorithms(strategies) (Concrete implementation of the behaviour/algorithms
    Make them interchangeable (Make them the same type, through a construct such as an Interface)

    How do you get them into the classes?

        Add a class member to the Root(Parent class)
            -> Must of the Interface type of the strategies you defined
            : This is an exaple of composition (having class members that are objects)
